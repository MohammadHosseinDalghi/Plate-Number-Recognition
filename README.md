# License Plate Recognition System

## Project Overview

This project implements a License Plate Recognition (LPR) system using machine learning techniques. It processes images of license plates, extracts features, and accurately predicts the numbers displayed on the plates using a Logistic Regression model.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Resizes, blurs, and thresholds images for better accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes Logistic Regression for digit prediction.
- **Visualization:** Displays the detected license plate and predicted numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV:** For image processing.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
